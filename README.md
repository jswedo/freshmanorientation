Freshman Orientation

Library Orientation
 
The goal of this workshop is to introduce you to the JSerra Library and to provide you with the tools to access library catalogs, locate print materials in the library, use online databases and Internet search engines, and write a good 7th edition MLA format works cited list.
 
You will need your Internet-ready laptop and a pen or pencil to perform all the necessary tasks to complete this workshop.

File at the bottom of this webpage:

The 1st file called "20090701095636" is a Sample 7th edition MLA Paper with footnotes
The 2nd file called "2013-2014 Freshman English Beginning Instruction" is a PowerPoint used in class
The 3rd file called "MLA Review Sheet handout" is a 1-page MLA document which provides examples of some of the most commonly used sources cited in 7th edition MLA format.

 
INTRODUCTION
 
You may check out items from our library for three week intervals. At the end of your rental period, you must return the book or bring it in to renew it.
 
The JSerra Library is just like public libraries—we use the Dewey Decimal system, which is a cataloging system used to arrange our books on the shelves.
 
Watch this video for an explanation about call numbers Video Link; or see this website: Website Link.
 
Fiction books, which are novels or story books, are put on the shelf alphabetically, A to Z, by the author’s last name. So, obviously you need to know the author’s last name to find the book you want. So, a fiction book by George Orwell would be found on the shelf at F ORW (an “F” for fiction, and the 1st 3 letters of the author’s last name).
 
Non-fiction books are books that have factual information in them, like hurricanes, World War II, etc. Non-fiction books are assigned a number from 0 to 999, according to the Dewey system. They are put on the shelf by their number. So a book on Tornados is found at 551.55.
 
The 10 major Dewey Decimal divisions for non-fiction are:
 
000 – Generalities
100 – Philosophy & Psychology
200 – Religion
300 – Social Science
400 – Language
500 – Natural Science & Mathematics
600 – Technology & Applied Sciences
700 – Arts
800 – Literature
900 – Geography & History
 
Biographies are books about a person’s life and are in the 92 section.
 
Reference materials cannot be checked out. They are things like encyclopedias, dictionaries, atlases, and almanacs. Reference books have an “R” and a number that is 0 to 999, according to the Dewey system.
 
The JSerra Library Catalog (OPAC)
 
In our library, we use software called Follett to catalog books and materials. When new things come in, they need to be input into the catalog and assigned a location on the shelf. Here is an example of a MARC record, which is a Machine Readable Catalog record.

Our catalog is available online, so we call it an OPAC, which means Online Public Access Catalog. If you are at home or in class and need to see if we have a book on the shelf, you can go to our OPAC and check to see if we have it.
 
The OPAC is on the jserra.org website on the library page under the right sidebar called Library Catalog. To access the JSerra catalog, click this link: Catalog.
 
JSerra Catalog Activity
 
Spend a few minutes looking at the JSerra catalog. Search for a book by subject and go and find it on the shelf. Write down its title and barcode number on your worksheet under number 1. JSerra barcodes are on the back of the book in the upper righthand corner.
 
Public Library Catalogs
 
Another catalog you can access online is the OCPL. This is a county system, and they have branches all over Orange County. Let’s look at their catalog for a moment. Their website is www.ocpl.org. OCPL Link.
 
City Public Libraries
 
Mission Viejo and Newport Beach have city libraries - not part of the county system. Their catalogs are available here: Mission Viejo MVPL, and Newport Beach NBPL.
 
24/7 Reference
 
The public library systems offered a 24/7 reference system to help people at all times of day or night with research questions. The service has been suspended at this time due to budget cuts, but they hope to reinstate it soon.
 
OCPL Catalog Activity
 
Take a couple minutes to look over their website and use their catalog to find a book on any subject you like. Search for a book at the branch library nearest your home. Put the title of the book and its call number down on your worksheet under number 2.
 
EBSCO and Facts on File Online Databases
 
We will discuss how to use online databases, which are designed specifically for students doing academic research. JSerra subscribes to a series of databases by two different companies - one is called EBSCO - and the other is Facts on File. You can find the research databases on the library webpage under the right tab called Research Databases & Videos.
 
The databases we offer are:
 
EBSCO:
Science Reference Center
History Reference Center
Literary Reference Center
Ultra Online K-12 Research Center (magazines, newspapers, encyclopedias)
Religion & Philosophy Collection
 
Facts on File:
Classroom Videos on Demand
Bloom's Literature Reference Center
American History
Modern World History
Ancient & Medieval History
Science Online.
 
One other word about subscription databases … the public libraries, including Orange County Public Library, Mission Viejo, and Newport Beach, give you access to even more databases. You can use their databases for free with your library card number. Please get a library card from your closest public library.
 
Internet Search Engines
 
A search engine is an Information Retrieval System. There are all kinds, there are ones that specialize, and some are better than others.
 
One of the top search engines is clearly google.com, but less than half of the searchable Internet is searchable using Google alone. Overlap studies have shown that about 1/2 of the pages in any database ONLY exist in that database. Therefore, the use of a second search engine is recommended to double-check your results. A second recommended search engine would be Yahoo.Search or Ask.com.
 
Learning to use search engines is a skill that one should practice.
 
Most of them have an About link which will give you further instruction on conducting Higher Level searches using certain criteria.
 
Google has different levels of search. We are going to spend a couple minutes looking over Google and Google Scholar. Click the link to go to Google: Google. Be sure to try WonderWheel and TimeLine features in Google and try using site limiters to find only educational, organizational or governmental sites. Type in site:edu or site:org or site:gov with the search term to limit your results to those types of entities. Here is a link to Google Scholar: Scholar.
 
For a refresher on Google Search Tips, watch this video from YouTube: Google Search Tricks & Tips.
 
Yahoo! Search is found at http://search.yahoo.com. Yahoo also offers an advanced search. Click this link: Yahoo.
 
MLA Citations & Research Assistance
 
When doing your works cited lists for research papers, you must use the most recent MLA citation style. Right now, that is the 7th edition, which came out in April 2009.
 
JSerra has its own writing standards which follow 7th edition MLA format. To view the JSerra Writing Standards as to how to format your papers, see this link: Standards.  When you have a research project, it is likely that I will be visiting your class to assist you with your research. One aspect of that instruction, is that I grade a portion of your papers -- the research, MLA, and Annotated Bibliography sections. I have attached below under Files, the rubric that I usually use when grading your papers.
 
We do NOT recommend using online citation makers to generate your citations, as they are often wrong. If you put the wrong information in the boxes when filling out a citation maker - the citation will also be wrong. Garbage in - Garbage out.  If you want to use despite that warning, we recommend NoodleTools Express. See this link: Noodle Tools. Please be critical of the citations these generators make.
 
If you prefer help in print to do your citations, I have print MLA citation forms in the library. They are for several different types of citations and are always found at the Citation Station. Ms. Swedo is available to answer any question you might have - in person or via JSerra email: jswedo@jserra.org

 
Search Engine & MLA Activity
 
Please select one of the search engines we discussed previously and conduct a search on an appropriate subject of your choice. Be sure you note which search engine you use, your search term, the URL of the website you select.
 
Use the link to the online citation maker to write your citation for that website.
Fill in all the blanks on your worksheet under number 5.
 
Plagiarism Tutorial
 
Faculty at JSerra use Turnitin.com to assess the amount of, if any, material that was borrowed from outside sources. You will be instructed by your classroom teachers about how to access your Turnitin.com account when submitting assignments to be run through the Turnitin.com database. To login to your Turnitin.com account, see this link: Turnitin.com.
 
Use your laptops to take this online tutorial on plagiarism. Tutorial.
